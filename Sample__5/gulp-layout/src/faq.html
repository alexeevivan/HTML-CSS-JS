							<br>
							<p>
								By ordering the Products and/or accepting delivery of the Products from Shop, the
								Customer agrees that it is bound by
								these Terms and Conditions of sale. Customer orders, including orders placed via the
								internet, are subject to acceptance
								by Shop. The acceptance of the Customer's order by Shop is expressly made conditional
								upon the Customer's assent to
								these Terms and Conditions which will prevail notwithstanding anything that may be
								stated to the contrary on the
								Customer's order. Shop reserves the right to vary any of these terms at any time and any
								subsequent orders placed by the
								Customer will constitute an acceptance of the terms as varied. Once a Customer order has
								been placed and accepted by
								Shop, the Customer agrees that the Customer has no right to cancel or vary the order at
								any time, unless agreed upon in
								writing by both parties.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div id="quotations">
							<h5>
								Quotations
							</h5>
							<br>
							<p>
								Any quotation by Shop to the Customer will be open for acceptance by the Customer within
								the period stated in the
								quotation or, where no period is stated, within seven (7) days from the date of the
								quotation. Thereafter, prices stated
								in the quotation may be varied by Shop without notice to the Customer.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div id="prices">
							<h5>
								Prices / Taxes
							</h5>
							<br>
							<p>
								The prices charged by and payable to Shop will be the ruling prices applicable at the
								time of order placement, provided
								that the Products are accepted for delivery within a reasonable time. Prices are subject
								to change without notice.
								Recommended retail prices are provided for indicative purposes only and there is no
								obligation for Shop to comply with
								that recommendation. It as agreed that should the Customer fail for any reason to
								acquire the quantity of Products sold
								then without limiting Shop' other rights and remedies the unit price charged for the
								goods sold may be amended to take
								into account any variation in the total quantity purchased by the Customer. Prices
								include GST, but do not include any
								other tax or duty, which is in addition to the price and is to be paid by the Customer
								at the time of payment for the
								Products.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div id="terms">
							<h5>
								Terms of Payment
							</h5>
							<br>
							<p>
								Credit Card Payments may attract a surcharge, and Shop will inform the Customer if this
								is to be the case before
								processing the transaction.
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								Unless otherwise agreed in writing by Shop, where Shop has not agreed in writing to
								provide commercial credit to the
								Customer, the total purchase price for Products supplied will be due for payment in cash
								prior to delivery.
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								Where Shop has agreed in writing to provide commercial credit to the Customer, the
								Customer must make payments in
								accordance with the payment terms provided by Shop.
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								Where Shop has approved the provision of a commercial credit arrangement with the
								Customer but has not provided notice
								of the payment terms to the Customer, the Customer must pay the total purchase price for
								Products supplied within seven
								days of the statement date.
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								Credit Card Payment at an Invoice or transaction level may also be offered to the
								Customer as a stand-alone payment
								method, or in conjunction with Credit Card Direct Debit Authorisation.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div id="credit-accounts">
							<h5>
								Credit Accounts
							</h5>
							<br>
							<p>
								Any commercial credit arrangements that are provided to the Customer by Shop will
								continue until terminated by Shop at
								it sole discretion. In the event that Shop terminates the Customer's commercial credit
								arrangement, the Customer will be
								notified in writing and termination will take effect upon receipt of that notification
								by the Customer.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div id="change-of-ownership">
							<h5>
								Change of Ownership
							</h5>
							<br>
							<p>
								Trading accounts are approved by Shop based on the information supplied and the
								representations made by the Customer. In
								the event that there is a change in ownership of the Customer, whether total or partial,
								the Customer must immediately
								provide written notice to Shop informing Shop of these changes. Until Shop receives
								written notice from the Customer of
								a change in ownership, the Customer (including where it is a company or trustee, each of
								the Directors thereof) holds
								Shop indemnified against any and all losses, unpaid accounts, interest, damages, costs,
								charges, fees and expenses
								incurred or suffered by Shop in trading with any person, company (including the same
								company but with a different
								shareholder or shareholders) or other entity (including a trust) which may have
								purchased the Customer's business or any
								interest in the Customer's business or any of the shares in the Customer and used the
								Customer's previously approved
								account for trading.
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								Where a Customer has been authorised by Shop to make payments through Credit Card Direct
								Debit, the Customer must
								provide notice in writing at least five (5) days prior to any change in ownership of the
								business to allow Shop
								sufficient time to contact the new owner to obtain and confirm new Credit Card
								information if applicable.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div id="info-products-supplied">
							<h5>
								Information on the Products supplied
							</h5>
							<br>
							<p>
								AAll descriptive specifications, illustrations, drawings, data, dimensions and weights
								furnished by Shop or otherwise
								contained in catalogues or other advertising material are approximate only and are
								intended to be merely a general
								description of the goods, are not incorporated within this agreement and no not form
								part of the description of the
								goods sold under this or any other agreement unless otherwise agreed to in writing by
								Shop in which case such
								information will be subject to recognised trade tolerances.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div id="delivery">
							<h5>
								Delivery
							</h5>
							<br>
							<p>
								The means of delivering the Products to the Customer will be at Shop' discretion. Shop
								reserves the right to deliver
								Products in part deliveries. In the event that Shop incurs additional costs for meeting
								special (i.e. Tasmania /
								Northern Territory Deliveries) or urgent delivery arrangements, these additional costs
								may be charged to the Customer
								and may include the cost of airfreight where it is not the normal method of delivery.
								The Customer agrees to accept
								delivery of the Products sold at any time during normal business hours.
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								Shop will not be liable for any loss or damage resulting from any late delivery of the
								Products and late delivery will
								not entitle the Customer to rescind or repudiate the Customer's order for the Products.
