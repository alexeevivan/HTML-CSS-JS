								By ordering the Products and/or accepting delivery of the Products from Shop, the
								Customer agrees that it is bound by
								these Terms and Conditions of sale. Customer orders, including orders placed via the
								internet, are subject to acceptance
								by Shop. The acceptance of the Customer's order by Shop is expressly made conditional
								upon the Customer's assent to
								these Terms and Conditions which will prevail notwithstanding anything that may be
								stated to the contrary on the
								Customer's order. Shop reserves the right to vary any of these terms at any time and any
								subsequent orders placed by the
								Customer will constitute an acceptance of the terms as varied. Once a Customer order has
								been placed and accepted by
								Shop, the Customer agrees that the Customer has no right to cancel or vary the order at
								any time, unless agreed upon in
								writing by both parties.
							</p>

								Products supplied within seven

							<br>
							<p>
								Any commercial credit arrangements that are provided to the Customer by Shop will

						</div>
						<div id="change-of-ownership">
							<h5>
								Change of Ownership
							</h5>

								Trading accounts are approved by Shop based on the information supplied and the
								representations made by the Customer. In
								the event that there is a change in ownership of the Customer, whether total or partial,
								the Customer must immediately
								provide written notice to Shop informing Shop of these changes. Until Shop receives
								written notice from the Customer of
								a change in ownership, the Customer (including where it is a company or trustee, each of
								the Directors thereof) holds
								Shop indemnified against any and all losses, unpaid accounts, interest, damages, costs,
								charges, fees and expenses
								incurred or suffered by Shop in trading with any person, company (including the same
								company but with a different

							<br>
							<p>
								Where a Customer has been authorised by Shop to make payments through Credit Card Direct

								provide notice in writing at least five (5) days prior to any change in ownership of the

								information if applicable.

								may be charged to the Customer
								and may include the cost of airfreight where it is not the normal method of delivery.
								The Customer agrees to accept
								delivery of the Products sold at any time during normal business hours.
							</p>
